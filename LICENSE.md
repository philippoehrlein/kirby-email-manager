### Licensee: 
  The individual or entity that purchases and holds a valid license for the Email Manager plugin.
### Plugin (“Email Manager”): 
  A Kirby plugin enabling developers to create contact forms using Kirby’s typical syntax (YML blueprints and PHP templates). CMS users can customize options such as privacy checkboxes, recipient email(s), success messages, and email footers.
### Domain: 
  The unique domain (e.g., “example.com”) provided at the time of purchase, on which the Plugin is licensed for production use.

## Scope of the License
### Local and Non-Production Use: 
  The Plugin may be freely used, modified, and tested in local or staging environments that are not publicly accessible. No license is required for such use.
### Production Use: 
  Each publicly accessible domain using the Plugin in a production environment requires a valid license.

## License Purchase
### Acquisition: 
  Licenses must be purchased via the plugin website (https://email-manager.philippoehrlein.de). The Licensee will provide a domain during checkout, and the license will be bound to that specific domain. The Checkout process is handled by Paddle.
### No Domain Transfer: 
  Once a license is assigned to a domain, it cannot be transferred to another domain.

## Rights and Restrictions
### Permitted Use: 
  The Licensee is granted the right to install and use the Plugin on the licensed domain in a production environment.
### Source Code Access: 
  The Plugin’s source code may be publicly viewed (e.g., on GitHub), but this does not grant rights to reproduce, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of the Plugin without explicit written permission from the Licensor.
### No Redistribution: 
  The Licensee shall not sell, lease, rent, sublicense, redistribute, or otherwise transfer the Plugin or any portion thereof to any third party.

## Updates and Support
### Unlimited Updates: 
  The Licensee is entitled to all future updates and new versions of the Plugin without any time limitation.

### Support:

### Limitation of Liability: 
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA, DOWNTIME, OR LOST PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PLUGIN, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

### Jurisdiction: 
  The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this license is Stuttgart, Germany, insofar as legally permissible.

## Severability
If any provision of this license is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

## Amendments
